_**MGS data of one MAFLD cohorts was used as demo data throughout the first 6 chapters in this tutorial.**_  

8 MGS samples of 4 patients from 2 groups in MAFLD projects were used as Demo data.  

_**16S data of mouse fecal samples from BeiZhong E round project was used as demo data in Chapter 8 (PICRUSt2).**_  

_**Notably, only Genus names should be used as input in Chapter 7 for MSEA analysis.**_
