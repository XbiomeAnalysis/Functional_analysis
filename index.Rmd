# Introduction

---

**This is a tutorial introducing the analysis of microbiome functional data.**

Flowchart of this tutorial:  

![Flowchart](./flowcharts/FlowChart_index.jpg)  

---

_**MGS data of two cohorts were used as demo data throughout the first 6 chapters in this tutorial.**_  

One cohort contains 13 samples of 6 patients in GvHD project.  

The other cohort consist of 10 samples from 8 patients, 1 water tube and 1 BRS in Newtech project.  

The first cohort was used as the input data for MetaCyc database analysis and the other one was used as the input for the analysis of KEGG, VFDB, SCFA, CARD, CAZY databases.  

_**16S data of mouse fecal samples from BeiZhong E round project was used as demo data in Chapter 8 (PICRUSt2).**_  

_**Notably, only Genus names should be used as input in Chapter 7 for MSEA analysis.**_
